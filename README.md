##### Authors

##### Description
This repository contains all the main code for analyzing the effects of different tenure regimes on forest conversion to agriculture in Brazil from 1985-2018. 
The code provided here was developed and tested in R under versions versions 3.5.1-4.0.2, and all data used in these analyses is publicly available online. 
A detailed description of the underlying data and methods for this analysis is available at: https://doi.org/10.31223/X5D31J (preprint, publication is currently under revision).
This code in this repository is a guideline to reproduce our work, and as such, it reflects our own data structure, computational assets, and pre-processing steps required for these large-scale analyses (overall expected run-time is ~15 days using high performance computing). It should not be used as an exact template for immediate replication, but should provide guidance to reproduce 1) regression analyses outputs, 2) sensitivity analyses outputs (Rosenbaum bounds), and 3) syntheses tables of effect consistency across scales.
