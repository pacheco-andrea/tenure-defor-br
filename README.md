##### Authors
Andrea Pacheco, Carsten Meyer

##### Description
This repository contains all the main code for analyzing the causal effects of different tenure forms on forest conversion to agriculture in Brazil from 1985-2018. 
The code provided here is meant as a guideline to reproduce our work, and as such, it reflects our own data structure, computational assets, and pre-processing steps. It is not a template to use for immediate replication of these large-scale analyses. Although we do not provide the raw data, all data used in these analyses is available online. We provide a detailed description of the underlying data and methods in a dedicated paper (currently submitting).
