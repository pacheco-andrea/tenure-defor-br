##### Authors
Andrea Pacheco, Carsten Meyer

##### Description
This repository contains all the main code for analyzing the effects of different tenure regimes on forest conversion to agriculture in Brazil from 1985-2018. 
The code provided here was developed and tested in R under versions versions 3.5.1-4.0.2. All data used in these analyses is publicly available online. 
This code in this repository is a guideline to reproduce our work, and as such, it reflects our own data structure, computational assets, and pre-processing steps required for these large-scale analyses. It should not be used as an exact template for immediate replication.  
We provide a detailed description of the underlying data and methods in a preprint available at: https://doi.org/10.31223/X5D31J.
